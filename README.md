To run the web application:
- upload the repository
- install bun
- cd to server
- run the command: bun install
- run the command: bun server.ts
- go to http://localhost:3000


Note:
after trying a single file, if you want to try another one, you need to delete the file mydb.sqlite and restart the server :(
